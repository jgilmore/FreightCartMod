					<Text>The Freight System Monitor provides useful information about your freight networks to better track your resource supply and demand.  Press E to access the panel's display.  You can cycle through each freight network one at a time with the provided buttons or bring up a list to select the specific network of interest.
					
					You can also switch the view to view your global mass inventory.  This will display a listing of all contents of all mass storage arrays that are connected to your freight system.  Within this menu are the options to filter by item name or inventory count.
					
					For additional information on freight system terminology see the following page.  For more information on configuring your freight networks and freight items see explanations in the Freight Cart Station entry.</Text>

				<Paragraph>
					<Text>Each freight network consists of an array freight items that are player defined for transport within the system.  Each of these freight items has four key properties associated with it: Inventory, Deficit, Surplus, and Transit Quantity.
					
					The inventory is the total quantity of the freight item that exists within mass storage crates that are connected to the network.
					
					Deficit is the sum of items that all mass storage crates on the network require to satisfy their Request setpoints.
					
					Surplus is the excess of items that crates have available to Offer to other crates on the network.  If Surplus is greater than Deficit then given time the freight carts can distribute these excess goods to the stations that request them.
					
					Transit Quantity is the total number of items currently carried by freight carts on the network.  Freight carts will only collect items from a station if the transit quantity is less than the network deficit.  Once the quantity is reached the carts will be able to satisfy the deficit so no additional items are required.</Text>
